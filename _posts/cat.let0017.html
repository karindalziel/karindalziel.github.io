Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer

                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.

Cather’s
                           sister. </span>Born in Red Cloud, NE, shortly before Willa Cather
                        graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in
                        Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in
                        Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin
                        in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914
                        and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in
                        English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she
                        studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in
                        1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then
                        lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA;
                        Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her
                        home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where
                        she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues.
                        Willa Cather's expectation that Elsie be responsible for aging family and
                        friends and for legal affairs after their parents' deaths sometimes brought
                        the sisters into conflict. Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in
                        1942. She died in Lincoln.

                        Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High
                        School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the
                        University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high
                        school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of
                        schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he
                        married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an
                        abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret
                        and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe
                        became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA,
                        where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in
                        the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank
                        until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several
                        times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926
                        trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San
                        Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle
                        family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was
                        one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a
                        prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932).

                        Bohemia, Wiener came to the U.S. with his family in 1860; he enlisted in the
                        Navy during the Civil War, then joined his family in Chicago, IL. He married
                        Fannie Meyer; they had no children. In 1883 Wiener bought a clothing store
                        in Red Cloud, NE, where they became prominent citizens; for a time during
                        Cather’s childhood they lived across the street from the Charles F. Cather
                        home. Wiener was elected mayor of Red Cloud in 1893, the year his wife died,
                        and county commissioner in 1896. In 1897 he sold his store and moved to New
                        York, living with an elder brother and going into the real estate business
                        with a nephew; he remarried in 1906. Cather regarded Wiener as a friend from
                        her youth until his death, visiting him while they both lived in New York;
                        she portrayed him and Fanny Wiener as the Rosens in “Old Mrs. Harris.”

                        1859, where her father kept hotels in Nevada County; she first met Silas
                        Garber there in 1866 when he was visiting his elder brother Jacob. Lyra
                        reportedly attended a convent school in Grass Valley, CA, and a finishing
                        school in San Francisco. In 1875, when Silas Garber was governor of
                        Nebraska, he returned to Grass Valley and married Lyra Wheeler. After his
                        term was up in 1878, the couple moved to Red Cloud, NE. Widowed in 1905,
                        Lyra stayed there until 1912. In 1914 settled in Grangeville, ID, where a
                        sister lived, and cut her ties to Nebraska. In 1915, she married Swan
                        Anderson, a considerably-younger bank cashier. They moved to Oregon in 1918,
                        where she died. Cather observed Silas and Lyra Garber during their Red Cloud
                        years and made them the prototypes for Daniel and Marian Forrester in <em class="hi">A Lost Lady</em> (1923).

                        Library School (1892). In 1892 she was hired as the first professional
                        librarian at the University of Nebraska; she resigned in 1897 in protest
                        over Chancellor George MacLean’s cuts to the library budget and staff
                        salaries. She briefly took positions in Illinois and Iowa before becoming
                        librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library in 1899. She died in Los
                        Angeles. Jones and Willa Cather were acquainted during Cather’s student
                        years, and in March 1895 they traveled together to Chicago, IL, to attend a
                        series of Metropolitan Opera performances.

                        Katherine was the third of four children born to J.B. and Helen Weston, who
                        became well-to-do residents of Beatrice, NE, thirty miles south of Lincoln,
                        NE. She entered the University of Nebraska in 1887, but withdrew for several
                        years due to poor health. When she returned in 1891, she met Cather. She
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud in the summers of 1891, 1894, and 1895, and
                        Cather visited Weston in Beatrice in June, July, and December 1895, where
                        Cather also enjoyed the company of Katherine’s younger brother Herbert
                        (Bert). Katherine attended the library school of the University of Illinois
                        as a member of the class of 1898 but withdrew in 1897. She then remained at
                        home until her June 1902 marriage to Thomas E. Wing, a fellow 1894
                        University of Nebraska graduate. She moved with him to Scarsdale, NY, where
                        she died of pneumonia in 1903.

                        Roscoe and sister Olivia. Cather was deeply infatuated with Louise, who was
                        both an outstanding student and an accomplished multi-sport athlete. Pound
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud, NE, several times, but she apparently did not
                        reciprocate Cather’s intense affection, and Cather’s lampoon of Roscoe Pound
                        in “Pastels in Prose” (1894) caused a rift between the two women. Pound
                        earned a B.A. from Nebraska in 1892, an M.A. in 1895, and a Ph.D. from the
                        University of Heidelberg in 1900. She was a professor in the English
                        department at the University of Nebraska, where she taught Cather's sister
                        Elsie, until 1945. From 1954-55 she served as the first female president of
                        the Modern Language Association.

Cather’s
                           brother. </span>Born in Virginia and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Charles
                        was third child and second son of Charles and Virginia Cather. As an
                        adolescent, Douglass Cather helped his father supervise rented farm
                        properties and worked as a messenger for the local Burlington &amp; Missouri
                        Railroad office. In 1897 he left Red Cloud for a position in Sterling, CO,
                        and then took a position with at the Cheyenne, WY, office of the Burlington
                        Railroad. In 1908 he traveled to Mexico, an experience that his sister gave
                        to Emil Bergson in <em class="hi">O Pioneers!</em> (1913). By 1910 he was
                        living in Winslow, AZ, still working for the Burlington, where Willa Cather
                        visited him in 1912. He later achieved success in the oil business in
                        California. Although he never married, Cather notes that during the last six
                        or seven years of his life he had a relationship with Dorothy Rogers.
                        Douglass visited Cather in New York City in December of 1937. His death in
                        June 1938 left her devastated. Douglass served as a prototype for one of the
                        twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932) and Hector
                        the messenger boy brother in “The Best Years” (1948). His years working for
                        the Burlington also inspired Cather’s many railroad worker characters in her
                        novels, including <em class="hi">Song of the Lark</em> (1915) and <em class="hi">The Professor’s House</em> (1925). Few letters from this
                        important sibling relationship have survived.
