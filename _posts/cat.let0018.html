                        Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High
                        School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the
                        University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high
                        school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of
                        schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he
                        married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an
                        abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret
                        and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe
                        became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA,
                        where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in
                        the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank
                        until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several
                        times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926
                        trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San
                        Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle
                        family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was
                        one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a
                        prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932).

                        Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in
                        Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin
                        in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914
                        and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in
                        English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she
                        studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in
                        1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then
                        lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA;
                        Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her
                        home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where
                        she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues.
                        Willa Cather's expectation that Elsie be responsible for aging family and
                        friends and for legal affairs after their parents' deaths sometimes brought
                        the sisters into conflict. Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in
                        1942. She died in Lincoln.

                           </span>James was born in Red Cloud, NE, the fifth child and third son of
                        Charles and Virginia Cather. James moved to Wyoming in 1907 to work with his
                        brothers Douglass and Roscoe. In 1913 he married Ethel Garber, and owned and
                        operated clothing stores first in Red Cloud and then Holyoke, CO, where the
                        family settled for a time 1920 before returning to Red Cloud in 1922. The
                        couple had two children, Helen Louise and Charles Edwin. In 1930 the family
                        moved to California so James could work in the oil business with Douglass
                        and his partners. Willa’s relationship with James was more distant than that
                        with her brothers Douglass and Roscoe, who were closer to her own age,
                        although she was very fond of his children.

Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer
                        in the oil industry in Cincinnati, OH, Casper, WY, and Bradford, PA. In 1936
                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.
