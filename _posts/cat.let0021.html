                           (1876-1951) (“Bert”). Cather’s Nebraska acquaintance. </span>Born in
                        Lincoln, NE, Bert Weston was raised in Beatrice, NE, by his father, J.B.
                        Weston, one of the town’s founding settlers and most prominent citizens, and
                        mother Helen Towle Weston. His sister Katherine was Cather’s University of
                        Nebraska classmate, and Cather met Bert when she visited her friend in
                        Beatrice. After graduating from Beatrice High School, Bert Weston’s parents
                        sent him to the Michigan Military Academy in Orchard Lake, MI, in 1893.
                        After graduating from MMA in 1895, Weston was admitted to the Sheffield
                        Scientific School at Yale University. In 1898 he joined the First
                        Connecticut Light Infantry in hopes of fighting in the Spanish-American War
                        but never saw action. He returned to Beatrice at the war’s end and married
                        Margaret Collins of Brooklyn, NY, in 1903. They raised three sons in
                        Beatrice, where Bert worked for the family business, the Beatrice National
                        Bank, established his own business, Nebraska Corn Mills, and managed the
                        Western business interests of his wife’s family.

                        Wisconsin, Ella Wheeler began writing poetry at an early age; her poems were
                        published in newspapers, earning her a state-wide reputation while in her
                        teens. Her <em class="hi">Drops of Water</em> (1872), a book of

                        Attacks on the supposed immorality of that volume and ridicule of its naïve
                        versification and sentiments were almost as widespread as its popularity,
                        with Cather being among the scoffers. Wheeler married Robert Wilcox in 1884;
                        they had one child, who died at birth. She continued to publish
                        prolifically; as she became interested in theosophy and spiritualism, she
                        also wrote on those topics.

Cather’s
                           brother. </span>Born in Virginia and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Charles
                        was third child and second son of Charles and Virginia Cather. As an
                        adolescent, Douglass Cather helped his father supervise rented farm
                        properties and worked as a messenger for the local Burlington &amp; Missouri
                        Railroad office. In 1897 he left Red Cloud for a position in Sterling, CO,
                        and then took a position with at the Cheyenne, WY, office of the Burlington
                        Railroad. In 1908 he traveled to Mexico, an experience that his sister gave
                        to Emil Bergson in <em class="hi">O Pioneers!</em> (1913). By 1910 he was
                        living in Winslow, AZ, still working for the Burlington, where Willa Cather
                        visited him in 1912. He later achieved success in the oil business in
                        California. Although he never married, Cather notes that during the last six
                        or seven years of his life he had a relationship with Dorothy Rogers.
                        Douglass visited Cather in New York City in December of 1937. His death in
                        June 1938 left her devastated. Douglass served as a prototype for one of the
                        twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932) and Hector
                        the messenger boy brother in “The Best Years” (1948). His years working for
                        the Burlington also inspired Cather’s many railroad worker characters in her
                        novels, including <em class="hi">Song of the Lark</em> (1915) and <em class="hi">The Professor’s House</em> (1925). Few letters from this
                        important sibling relationship have survived.

                        Westerman was a member of Phi Delta Theta. In his senior year a humorous

                        “Girls,” although Cather’s references to him suggest he pursued girls
                        somewhat aggressively. A captain of Company A of the university’s cadet
                        corps, he joined the US Army after graduation, serving as a captain in the
                        Spanish American War and as a colonel under his college cadet commander,
                        General John J. Pershing in World War I. From 1930 to 1939 he was commandant
                        of cadets at the University of Nebraska.

                        while writing poetry and plays. His <em class="hi">Letters from My

                        Other important works were the <em class="hi">Tatarin</em> books, <em class="hi">Artists’ Wives</em> (1874), <em class="hi">Kings in

                        wrote the incidental music. Daudet married writer Julia Allard in 1867; like
                        Baudelaire and Manet, he suffered from syphilis. Cather refers to Daudet
                        frequently in her newspaper criticism, and in 1891 Cather and her female
                        friends in Lincoln, NE, were sharing a copy of Daudet’s scandalous novel <em class="hi">Sapho</em> (1884); in “Coming Aphrodite” (1920), Cather

Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer
                        in the oil industry in Cincinnati, OH, Casper, WY, and Bradford, PA. In 1936
                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.
