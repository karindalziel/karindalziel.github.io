Cather’s father.
                           </span>Charles Cather was born in the Back Creek Valley of Virginia, north
                        of Winchester. His family were sheep raisers who were largely, but not
                        entirely, Union supporters during the Civil War. He married Mary Virginia
                        Sibert Boak, daughter of Confederate supporters, in 1872. In 1883 he and his
                        family followed his parents, William and Caroline Cather, and brother George
                        to Webster County in Nebraska, where various cousins and uncles had also
                        settled. Initially he ran a ranch in the county but soon moved his family
                        into the town of Red Cloud, where he had an insurance and real estate
                        business. Four of his children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles, and Jessica, were
                        born in Virginia, while three, James, Elsie, and John, were born in
                        Nebraska. Cather’s relationship with her father was very warm: she made
                        regular visits to her parents in Red Cloud and especially enjoyed her
                        father’s letters expressing appreciation of her novels. A week after she
                        concluded a visit to her ailing father in Red Cloud, he died of heart
                        disease. He served as the prototype for Hillary Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932).

                        Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and
                        was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872.
                        Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War
                        while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the
                        Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage
                        she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa,
                        Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while
                        three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were
                        born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional
                        differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who
                        remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her
                        husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her
                        children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a
                        sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there
                        several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to
                        Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931.
                        Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s

                        student at the University of Leipzig but left in 1829 to pursue a career as
                        a concert-pianist. After injuring his hand, Schumann pursued composing. In

                        where his father was an engineer for the Burlington Railroad. Carlisle
                        attended the University of Nebraska with the class of 1895 but did not
                        graduate. In 1896 Carlisle was teaching music in Lincoln, but the family
                        apparently left Lincoln soon thereafter. Cather mentions Tucker in her
                        review of a student performance of classical plays in 1894.

                           </span>Born in Virginia, Oury graduated from the University of Nebraska in
                        1897. While there he played on the football team and with William and Louis
                        Westerman was a member of Phi Delta Theta. In his senior year a humorous
                        table of the attributes of class members noted that his deficiency was
                        “Girls,” although Cather’s references to him suggest he pursued girls
                        somewhat aggressively. A captain of Company A of the university’s cadet
                        corps, he joined the US Army after graduation, serving as a captain in the
                        Spanish American War and as a colonel under his college cadet commander,
                        General John J. Pershing in World War I. From 1930 to 1939 he was commandant
                        of cadets at the University of Nebraska.
