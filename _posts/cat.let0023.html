                        graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, in 1861 and joined the
                        Union army. In 1865 he moved to Nebraska, where his family had moved.
                        Politically active in the Republican Party, he moved to Lincoln, NE, and
                        founded the city’s first newspaper, the <em class="hi">Nebraska State
                           Journal</em>. He married Mariel E. Clapham of Washington, D.C., in 1871.
                        While serving as a representative in the first state legislature, he helped
                        found the University of Nebraska, for which he served as regent from 1882 to
                        1892. Cather wrote for his newspaper when she was a university student, and
                        became a friend of Charles and Mariel Gere’s three daughters, Mariel, Ellen,
                        and Frances. She remembered Charles Gere’s “kindness, his easy wit, the ease
                        and charm of his personality.”

                        before coming to Red Cloud, NE, in 1874. He was admitted to the bar in 1876
                        and was, for many years, the local representative for the Burlington
                        Railroad’s land office; he retired in 1896. He served on the state board of
                        education and was a regent of the University of Nebraska from 1894 to 1898.
                        Cather appealed to him in 1896 when she applied for a teaching position at
                        the university. Kaley and his wife, Cyrelia Widney Kaley, had no children,
                        but several brothers, an uncle, and cousins lived in Red Cloud at various
                        times; one of his sisters, Anna, married Howard Cather, Charles F. Cather’s
                        cousin.

                        H. Morrill fought in the Civil War with the 11th New Hampshire Volunteers.
                        After the war, he moved west, eventually settling near Stromsburg, NE, where
                        he was successful in banking. In 1890, Morrill was elected to the Board of
                        Regents of the University of Nebraska; soon after he and his family moved to
                        Lincoln, NE, where he grew increasingly active in the Republican party. He
                        was the elected President of the Board from 1893 to 1903. In the 1890s he
                        began the Morrill Geological Expedition to gather fossils, primarily in
                        western Nebraska. A major financial benefactor to the University, he also
                        donated his fossil collection to its museum. When a new museum opened in
                        1927 it was named Morrill Hall in his honor.
