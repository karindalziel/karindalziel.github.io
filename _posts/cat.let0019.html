                  <p class="tei_p">241 N. Cedar Street (Red Cloud, NE): Built circa 1879, the Charles F. Cather family
                     rented this home beginning in 1884. Willa Cather’s room was in the attic and her
                     original wallpaper remains to this day. Charles and Mary Virginia Cather lived in
                     this
                     house until they purchased the 541 N. Seward Street house in 1903, although Willa
                     Cather
                     moved out in 1896. Cather used this home as a prototype most clearly in "Old Mrs.
                     Harris," although she memorably describes her attic bedroom and wallpaper in <em class="hi">The Song of the Lark</em> (1915).

                        graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in
                        Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in
                        Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin
                        in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914
                        and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in
                        English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she
                        studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in
                        1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then
                        lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA;
                        Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her
                        home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where
                        she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues.
                        Willa Cather's expectation that Elsie be responsible for aging family and
                        friends and for legal affairs after their parents' deaths sometimes brought
                        the sisters into conflict. Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in
                        1942. She died in Lincoln.

Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer
                        in the oil industry in Cincinnati, OH, Casper, WY, and Bradford, PA. In 1936
                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.

                        while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the
                        Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage
                        she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa,
                        Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while
                        three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were
                        born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional
                        differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who
                        remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her
                        husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her
                        children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a
                        sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there
                        several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to
                        Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931.
                        Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s
                        death.

Cather’s
                           brother. </span>Born in Virginia and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Charles
                        was third child and second son of Charles and Virginia Cather. As an
                        adolescent, Douglass Cather helped his father supervise rented farm
                        properties and worked as a messenger for the local Burlington &amp; Missouri
                        Railroad office. In 1897 he left Red Cloud for a position in Sterling, CO,
                        and then took a position with at the Cheyenne, WY, office of the Burlington
                        Railroad. In 1908 he traveled to Mexico, an experience that his sister gave
                        to Emil Bergson in <em class="hi">O Pioneers!</em> (1913). By 1910 he was
                        living in Winslow, AZ, still working for the Burlington, where Willa Cather
                        visited him in 1912. He later achieved success in the oil business in
                        California. Although he never married, Cather notes that during the last six
                        or seven years of his life he had a relationship with Dorothy Rogers.
                        Douglass visited Cather in New York City in December of 1937. His death in
                        June 1938 left her devastated. Douglass served as a prototype for one of the
                        twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932) and Hector
                        the messenger boy brother in “The Best Years” (1948). His years working for
                        the Burlington also inspired Cather’s many railroad worker characters in her
                        novels, including <em class="hi">Song of the Lark</em> (1915) and <em class="hi">The Professor’s House</em> (1925). Few letters from this
                        important sibling relationship have survived.

                        schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he
                        married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an

                        and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe
                        became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA,
                        where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in
                        the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank
                        until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several
                        times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926
                        trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San
                        Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle

                        one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a
