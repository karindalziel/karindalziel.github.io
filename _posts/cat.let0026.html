                        with their daughters Mariel, Ellen, and Frances, she welcomed her to their
                        home at 8th and D streets. Mrs. Gere, according to Cather, persuaded her to
                        grow out her close-cropped hair.

                        eldest daughter of Charles H. and Mariel C. Gere, born in Lincoln, NE,
                        entered the University of Nebraska's prep school in the same year Cather
                        did. She and her sisters visited Cather several times in Red Cloud, NE. Both
                        were members of the Union Literary Society until Gere joined the Kappa Kappa
                        Gamma sorority in 1892. Gere graduated in the science course and taught
                        chemistry at Lincoln High until 1941. She also served on the Lincoln City
                        Library board for many years. Cather and Gere remained friends and
                        correspondents; Gere defended Cather from accusations that she had been
                        arrogant and friendless during her university years.

Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer
                        in the oil industry in Cincinnati, OH, Casper, WY, and Bradford, PA. In 1936
                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.

                        Academy in Jacksonville, IL, in 1881. She married William Jennings Bryan in
                        1884 and moved with him to Lincoln, NE, in 1887. She read law under her

                        State. When he traveled the country as an orator, she managed their home in

                        developed in her middle age. Devastated by her husband’s assassination in

                        Admitted to the bar in 1868, he moved to Lincoln, NE in 1869, where he
                        served as deputy county clerk and county clerk before his election to the
                        lower house of the Nebraska state legislature in 1876. Phillips also worked

                        knew Phillips from her time in Lincoln.

                        Politically active in the Republican Party, he moved to Lincoln, NE, and
                        founded the city’s first newspaper, the <em class="hi">Nebraska State

                        While serving as a representative in the first state legislature, he helped
                        found the University of Nebraska, for which he served as regent from 1882 to
                        1892. Cather wrote for his newspaper when she was a university student, and
                        became a friend of Charles and Mariel Gere’s three daughters, Mariel, Ellen,
                        and Frances. She remembered Charles Gere’s “kindness, his easy wit, the ease
                        and charm of his personality.”
