                        University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where Cather also knew Louise’s brother
                        Roscoe and sister Olivia. Cather was deeply infatuated with Louise, who was
                        both an outstanding student and an accomplished multi-sport athlete. Pound
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud, NE, several times, but she apparently did not
                        reciprocate Cather’s intense affection, and Cather’s lampoon of Roscoe Pound
                        in “Pastels in Prose” (1894) caused a rift between the two women. Pound
                        earned a B.A. from Nebraska in 1892, an M.A. in 1895, and a Ph.D. from the
                        University of Heidelberg in 1900. She was a professor in the English
                        department at the University of Nebraska, where she taught Cather's sister
                        Elsie, until 1945. From 1954-55 she served as the first female president of
                        the Modern Language Association.

Cather’s father.
                           </span>Charles Cather was born in the Back Creek Valley of Virginia, north
                        of Winchester. His family were sheep raisers who were largely, but not
                        entirely, Union supporters during the Civil War. He married Mary Virginia
                        Sibert Boak, daughter of Confederate supporters, in 1872. In 1883 he and his
                        family followed his parents, William and Caroline Cather, and brother George
                        to Webster County in Nebraska, where various cousins and uncles had also
                        settled. Initially he ran a ranch in the county but soon moved his family
                        into the town of Red Cloud, where he had an insurance and real estate
                        business. Four of his children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles, and Jessica, were
                        born in Virginia, while three, James, Elsie, and John, were born in
                        Nebraska. Cather’s relationship with her father was very warm: she made
                        regular visits to her parents in Red Cloud and especially enjoyed her
                        father’s letters expressing appreciation of her novels. A week after she
                        concluded a visit to her ailing father in Red Cloud, he died of heart
                        disease. He served as the prototype for Hillary Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932).

                        Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and
                        was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872.
                        Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War
                        while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the
                        Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage
                        she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa,
                        Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while
                        three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were
                        born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional
                        differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who
                        remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her
                        husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her
                        children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a
                        sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there
                        several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to
                        Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931.
                        Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s
                        death.

                        Katherine was the third of four children born to J.B. and Helen Weston, who
                        became well-to-do residents of Beatrice, NE, thirty miles south of Lincoln,
                        NE. She entered the University of Nebraska in 1887, but withdrew for several
                        years due to poor health. When she returned in 1891, she met Cather. She
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud in the summers of 1891, 1894, and 1895, and
                        Cather visited Weston in Beatrice in June, July, and December 1895, where
                        Cather also enjoyed the company of Katherine’s younger brother Herbert
                        (Bert). Katherine attended the library school of the University of Illinois
                        as a member of the class of 1898 but withdrew in 1897. She then remained at
                        home until her June 1902 marriage to Thomas E. Wing, a fellow 1894
                        University of Nebraska graduate. She moved with him to Scarsdale, NY, where
                        she died of pneumonia in 1903.

Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer
                        in the oil industry in Cincinnati, OH, Casper, WY, and Bradford, PA. In 1936
                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.

Cather’s
                           brother. </span>Born in Virginia and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Charles
                        was third child and second son of Charles and Virginia Cather. As an
                        adolescent, Douglass Cather helped his father supervise rented farm
                        properties and worked as a messenger for the local Burlington &amp; Missouri
                        Railroad office. In 1897 he left Red Cloud for a position in Sterling, CO,
                        and then took a position with at the Cheyenne, WY, office of the Burlington
                        Railroad. In 1908 he traveled to Mexico, an experience that his sister gave
                        to Emil Bergson in <em class="hi">O Pioneers!</em> (1913). By 1910 he was
                        living in Winslow, AZ, still working for the Burlington, where Willa Cather
                        visited him in 1912. He later achieved success in the oil business in
                        California. Although he never married, Cather notes that during the last six
                        or seven years of his life he had a relationship with Dorothy Rogers.
                        Douglass visited Cather in New York City in December of 1937. His death in
                        June 1938 left her devastated. Douglass served as a prototype for one of the
                        twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932) and Hector
                        the messenger boy brother in “The Best Years” (1948). His years working for
                        the Burlington also inspired Cather’s many railroad worker characters in her
                        novels, including <em class="hi">Song of the Lark</em> (1915) and <em class="hi">The Professor’s House</em> (1925). Few letters from this
                        important sibling relationship have survived.

                        toured North America almost annually thereafter. After World War I

                        after the invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, he served as head
                        of the Polish government-in-exile in London. He died on a diplomatic and
                        musical tour of the U.S. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery; in

                        <span class="tei_label">Swinburne, Algernon Charles (1837-1909). British poet and critic.
                           </span>Born to a British naval officer and an aristocratic mother,
                        Swinburne was educated at Eton College and Oxford University. Influenced by
                        the Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne was early recognized as a major poetic talent
                        but was also criticized for tackling controversial political and sexual
                        themes. Cather first read Swinburne as a teenager in Red Cloud, NE, and in
                        1896 in the <em class="hi">Home Journal</em>, she wrote that “the man who
                        wrote ‘Atalanta in Calydon’,” the 1865 poem that made Swinburne famous, was
                        “the only English living poet who really deserved” to be British poet
                        laureate, but she conceded he was “shut out on erotic grounds.”
