                        corresponded with him after she moved to Pittsburgh, PA, in 1896, the same

                        year. In 1909, Wing married Helen Stanton Bouve, and they had two children.

                        Methodist minister. She attended the Normal School in Glasgow, Scotland,

                        many of whom died young. In 1853 the family emigrated to the U.S., living in
                        Chicago, IL, and then in Austin, TX. Widowed, Amelia Barr moved to New
                        Jersey in 1868, where she began writing for religious papers. By 1891 she
                        had achieved greater success with historical novels and stories. On a visit
                        to Pittsburgh in 1896, Barr met Cather, then the new editor of the <em class="hi">Home Monthly</em>.

                        <span class="tei_label">Kipling, Rudyard (1865-1936). English fiction writer and poet.
                           </span>Born in Bombay, India, to English parents, Kipling was sent to
                        England for his education but returned to India to work as a journalist. His
                        poems and short stories about India won him an audience in England, and he
                        settled in London in 1889. When he married Caroline Balestier in 1892, the
                        couple moved to her home state of Vermont. In 1896 Willa Cather claimed to
                        have met Kipling and she described the “46 minutes” of conversation with him
                        as “alone worth” her move to Pittsburgh to work for the <em class="hi">Home Monthly</em> (#0028). In 1899, Cather wrote a column about his
                        career for the <em class="hi">Lincoln Courier</em>, in which she noted
                        the irony of Kipling trying to “live a respectable Puritan life in Vermont
                        and be a full-fledged family man,” urging him to “Go back east.” In 1899, he
                        did leave the United States, but for London, not India, where he remained
                        the rest of his life. <em class="hi">McClure’s Magazine</em> published
                        Kipling’s poem “The White Man’s Burden” (1899) and the novel <em class="hi">Kim</em> (1900-1901), paying him $25,000 for serialization
                        of the latter. When Cather traveled to London on <em class="hi">McClure’s</em> business in 1906, she carried a letter of introduction
                        to him, but it is not clear whether she met him again there. Throughout her
                        life Cather expressed enthusiasm for Kipling’s works, which she associated
                        with a spirit of adventure, and her letters make clear that she followed his
                        life and career closely.
