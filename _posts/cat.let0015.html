            pop to go out in the country and stay in order that he might not bother the young
            lady. I was determined that she should not suffer what you <a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" class="let_annotation" data-placement="left auto" href="#ref005" rel="popover" data-popover-content="#annotationref005" title="Mariel Gere; Ellen Gere (Ned); Frances Gere">girls<sup class="ref_no">5</sup></a> had endured.<span class="letterPageBreak"> </span> James, being greatly in need of funds, went, but I,

            farmer who was coming to town and dashed in on the newly arrived. They got on much
            better than I expected, but you know Jim is disposed to be affectionate, and the
            young lady is not used to children and used to positively blush under his caresses.
            He made brakes (or is it breaks?) as usual. Imagine my horror when one morning at
            breakfast he cooly said, "I say, Louise, they've got some mighty nice<span class="letterPageBreak"> </span><span class="tei_type tei_type_pageNum tei_pageNum tei_place tei_place_top tei_top tei_fw"><u>2</u></span> chocolate drops downtown, suppose you set 'em up to me,

               up.</span> He liked her pretty well, but he struck the same ice that I have been
            three years getting through. He declares that "Louise is not as good as Ned's little
            finger." Tell Ned I have a lasting grudge against that little finger, though I am

The

            considering the universal disgust was a some what delicate question. The programmes
            were all printed in the paper and the fond mother bought fifty papers and sent them

            the way I must tell you about that aunt of mine some time, she is one of the

            ugliness and eccentricity.

         <p class="tei_p">One of our favorite amusements out there was sitting on <del class="tei_rend tei_rend_strikethrough tei_strikethrough tei_del">the</del> top of the fifty foot wind mill tower at night. It was great on calm
            evenings. We could see for miles and miles, see "right off the edge of the world"
            as
            Ross said. The red harvest moon,<span class="letterPageBreak"> </span> swollen with plenty,
            rose over the lagoons and wheat fields, not very clear at first, but fleecy and
            cloud girt, as though timid of her own <del class="tei_rend tei_rend_strikethrough tei_strikethrough tei_del">my c</del> richness
            and fullness. But in an hour or so, <del class="tei_rend tei_rend_strikethrough tei_strikethrough tei_del">she</del> when she
            felt the full zest of her race and the strength of her serenity, she left the vapors
            behind her. As soon as she was up, the little ponds all over the country began to
            glimmer, and the corn tassels in all those forests of corn looked white as silver.
            We could see the windmills and groves of cottonwoods all over the country as plainly
            as in day light. Moonlight has<span class="letterPageBreak"> </span><span class="tei_type tei_type_pageNum tei_pageNum tei_place tei_place_top tei_top tei_fw">5</span> a peculiar effect on a country; it obliterates what is ugly,
            softens what is harsh, and what is beautiful it raises almost to the divine and
            supernatural.
         </p>
         
         <p class="tei_p">But the greatest thing we saw from that mill tower was the coming of a storm. The
            moon did not show herself at all; there was a long black bank of clouds in the west,
            and the <span rel="tooltip" class="tei_sic" title="lightning​">lightening</span> kept playing along it as steady as the fire of a battery. The world seemed
            to get ready for a storm; the cattle all huddled together in one end of the <span rel="tooltip" class="tei_sic" title="corral​">corall</span>, the corn<span class="letterPageBreak"> </span> leaves got restless and began to
            toss their long blades up as if to reach for rain. In a moment the big wind struck
            us, just such a wind as struck Roscoe and the girls out by <a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" class="let_annotation" data-placement="left auto" href="#ref019" rel="popover" data-popover-content="#annotationref019" title="Read Annotation">the brick kiln<sup class="ref_no">19</sup></a>, and we fifty feet up in the air on a

            tower shook and we shook, the wind hummed and sang and whistled all about us, if it

                        both an outstanding student and an accomplished multi-sport athlete. Pound
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud, NE, several times, but she apparently did not
                        reciprocate Cather’s intense affection, and Cather’s lampoon of Roscoe Pound
                        in “Pastels in Prose” (1894) caused a rift between the two women. Pound
                        earned a B.A. from Nebraska in 1892, an M.A. in 1895, and a Ph.D. from the
                        University of Heidelberg in 1900. She was a professor in the English
                        department at the University of Nebraska, where she taught Cather's sister
                        Elsie, until 1945. From 1954-55 she served as the first female president of

                           </span>Charles Cather was born in the Back Creek Valley of Virginia, north
                        of Winchester. His family were sheep raisers who were largely, but not
                        entirely, Union supporters during the Civil War. He married Mary Virginia
                        Sibert Boak, daughter of Confederate supporters, in 1872. In 1883 he and his
                        family followed his parents, William and Caroline Cather, and brother George
                        to Webster County in Nebraska, where various cousins and uncles had also
                        settled. Initially he ran a ranch in the county but soon moved his family
                        into the town of Red Cloud, where he had an insurance and real estate
                        business. Four of his children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles, and Jessica, were
                        born in Virginia, while three, James, Elsie, and John, were born in
                        Nebraska. Cather’s relationship with her father was very warm: she made
                        regular visits to her parents in Red Cloud and especially enjoyed her
                        father’s letters expressing appreciation of her novels. A week after she
                        concluded a visit to her ailing father in Red Cloud, he died of heart
                        disease. He served as the prototype for Hillary Templeton in “Old Mrs.

                        University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high
                        school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of
                        schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he
                        married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an
                        abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret
                        and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe
                        became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA,
                        where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in
                        the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank
                        until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several
                        times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926
                        trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San
                        Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle
                        family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was
                        one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a
                        prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs.

                        including George’s parents, his sisters, and his brother Charles and family.
                        After early struggles, George and Franc Cather prospered, rearing five
                        children: Carrie, Blanche, Grosvenor P., and twins Oscar and Frank. George

                        <span class="tei_label">Emerson, Ralph Waldo (1803-1882). American writer and philosopher.
                           </span>Born in Boston, MA, son of a Unitarian minister, Emerson worked his
                        way through Harvard College, graduating in 1821. He taught school for
                        several years before entering Harvard Divinity School; he was ordained in
                        1829. The death of his first wife, Ellen Tucker, in 1831, increased his
                        doubts about organized religion, and he resigned his pulpit at a Unitarian
                        church. After a trip to Europe in 1832-33, Emerson embarked on a career as a
                        lecturer; many of his essays, such as “Nature” and “The American Scholar,”
                        began as lectures. He settled in Concord, MA, with his second wife Lydia and
                        their children, becoming center of a group of thinkers who became known as
                        Transcendentalists. He encouraged many other writers, such as Henry David
                        Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and Walt Whitman. After 1870 Emerson’s health and
                        memory began to decline, but he continued to be regarded as one of the
                        foremost thinkers of his time.

Cather’s brother.
                           </span>Born and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jack was the seventh child and
                        fourth son of Charles and Virginia Cather. He was nearly two decades younger
                        than Willa Cather, and she was a doting older sister when he was a small
                        boy. Because she missed him after her 1896 move to Pittsburgh, PA, she wrote
                        several poems about him and the story “Jack-a-Boy” (1901). After graduating
                        from Red Cloud High School in 1912, Jack studied for two years at University
                        of Nebraska in Lincoln. With Willa Cather’s encouragement, in 1914 he
                        enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to study
                        engineering. Willa Cather was then living in New York City but traveled to
                        Pittsburgh to help him settle in and enjoyed visiting him and supported his
                        decision to change his major to theater. It is not clear whether he
                        graduated from Carnegie Tech but the British government trained him as a
                        chemist so he could inspect munitions factories. While working in Smethport,
                        PA, he met Irma Wells, and they married in 1918. They had two children,
                        Catherine and Ella Faye. After World War I, he worked as a chemical engineer
                        in the oil industry in Cincinnati, OH, Casper, WY, and Bradford, PA. In 1936
                        he moved to Whittier, CA, and became a business partner with his brothers
                        Douglass and James in an oil production company. He died in Long Beach, CA.
                        Willa Cather mentions him frequently in letters, but she seems to have had
                        little contact with him and his family in later years, and no letters from
                        her to him have surfaced.

                        Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and
                        was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872.
                        Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War
                        while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the
                        Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage
                        she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa,
                        Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while
                        three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were
                        born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional
                        differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who
                        remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her
                        husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her
                        children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a
                        sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there
                        several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to
                        Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931.
                        Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s
                        death.
