                        correspondents; Gere defended Cather from accusations that she had been
                        arrogant and friendless during her university years.

Cather’s father.
                           </span>Charles Cather was born in the Back Creek Valley of Virginia, north
                        of Winchester. His family were sheep raisers who were largely, but not
                        entirely, Union supporters during the Civil War. He married Mary Virginia
                        Sibert Boak, daughter of Confederate supporters, in 1872. In 1883 he and his
                        family followed his parents, William and Caroline Cather, and brother George
                        to Webster County in Nebraska, where various cousins and uncles had also
                        settled. Initially he ran a ranch in the county but soon moved his family
                        into the town of Red Cloud, where he had an insurance and real estate
                        business. Four of his children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles, and Jessica, were
                        born in Virginia, while three, James, Elsie, and John, were born in
                        Nebraska. Cather’s relationship with her father was very warm: she made
                        regular visits to her parents in Red Cloud and especially enjoyed her
                        father’s letters expressing appreciation of her novels. A week after she
                        concluded a visit to her ailing father in Red Cloud, he died of heart
                        disease. He served as the prototype for Hillary Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932).

                        Roscoe and sister Olivia. Cather was deeply infatuated with Louise, who was
                        both an outstanding student and an accomplished multi-sport athlete. Pound
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud, NE, several times, but she apparently did not
                        reciprocate Cather’s intense affection, and Cather’s lampoon of Roscoe Pound
                        in “Pastels in Prose” (1894) caused a rift between the two women. Pound
                        earned a B.A. from Nebraska in 1892, an M.A. in 1895, and a Ph.D. from the
                        University of Heidelberg in 1900. She was a professor in the English
                        department at the University of Nebraska, where she taught Cather's sister
                        Elsie, until 1945. From 1954-55 she served as the first female president of
                        the Modern Language Association.

                        School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the
                        University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high
                        school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of
                        schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he
                        married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an
                        abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret
                        and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe
                        became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA,
                        where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in
                        the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank
                        until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several
                        times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926
                        trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San
                        Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle
                        family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was
                        one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a
                        prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs.
