                     moved out in 1896. Cather used this home as a prototype most clearly in "Old Mrs.

                        years due to poor health. When she returned in 1891, she met Cather. She
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud in the summers of 1891, 1894, and 1895, and
                        Cather visited Weston in Beatrice in June, July, and December 1895, where
                        Cather also enjoyed the company of Katherine’s younger brother Herbert
                        (Bert). Katherine attended the library school of the University of Illinois
                        as a member of the class of 1898 but withdrew in 1897. She then remained at
                        home until her June 1902 marriage to Thomas E. Wing, a fellow 1894

                        Lincoln, NE, Bert Weston was raised in Beatrice, NE, by his father, J.B.
                        Weston, one of the town’s founding settlers and most prominent citizens, and
                        mother Helen Towle Weston. His sister Katherine was Cather’s University of
                        Nebraska classmate, and Cather met Bert when she visited her friend in
                        Beatrice. After graduating from Beatrice High School, Bert Weston’s parents
                        sent him to the Michigan Military Academy in Orchard Lake, MI, in 1893.
                        After graduating from MMA in 1895, Weston was admitted to the Sheffield
                        Scientific School at Yale University. In 1898 he joined the First
                        Connecticut Light Infantry in hopes of fighting in the Spanish-American War
                        but never saw action. He returned to Beatrice at the war’s end and married
                        Margaret Collins of Brooklyn, NY, in 1903. They raised three sons in
                        Beatrice, where Bert worked for the family business, the Beatrice National
                        Bank, established his own business, Nebraska Corn Mills, and managed the

                           (1872-1951) (“Tom”). Willa Cather’s university friend, Edith Lewis’s
                           cousin. </span>Born in Davenport, IA, to George and Mary Gould Wing,
                        both transplanted New England Quakers, Tom Wing moved with his family c.
                        1886 to Lincoln, NE, where his mother’s sister, Lillie Gould Lewis, and her
                        family had settled. Lillie’s daughter Edith Lewis was thus his cousin. Tom
                        Wing earned a B.A. from the University of Nebraska in 1893 and a law degree
                        in 1896. The precise nature of Cather’s relationship with Wing when they
                        were contemporaries at the university is not clear, but she evidently
                        corresponded with him after she moved to Pittsburgh, PA, in 1896, the same
                        year he moved to New York City to practice law on Wall Street. In 1902, Wing
                        married Cather’s classmate and friend Katherine Weston, who died the next
                        year. In 1909, Wing married Helen Stanton Bouve, and they had two children.
                        Wing retired to Bennington County, VT, where Dorothy Canfield Fisher was a
                        neighbor. He died in Shaftsbury, VT.
