Cather’s father.
                           </span>Charles Cather was born in the Back Creek Valley of Virginia, north
                        of Winchester. His family were sheep raisers who were largely, but not
                        entirely, Union supporters during the Civil War. He married Mary Virginia
                        Sibert Boak, daughter of Confederate supporters, in 1872. In 1883 he and his
                        family followed his parents, William and Caroline Cather, and brother George
                        to Webster County in Nebraska, where various cousins and uncles had also
                        settled. Initially he ran a ranch in the county but soon moved his family
                        into the town of Red Cloud, where he had an insurance and real estate
                        business. Four of his children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles, and Jessica, were
                        born in Virginia, while three, James, Elsie, and John, were born in
                        Nebraska. Cather’s relationship with her father was very warm: she made
                        regular visits to her parents in Red Cloud and especially enjoyed her
                        father’s letters expressing appreciation of her novels. A week after she
                        concluded a visit to her ailing father in Red Cloud, he died of heart
                        disease. He served as the prototype for Hillary Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932).

                        married William Lee Boak in 1830, when she was about fifteen. In 1845 the
                        growing family moved to Washington, DC. They had nine children, with six
                        surviving to adulthood; one son was killed in the Civil War while serving in
                        the Confederate Army. Widowed in 1854, Mrs. Boak moved back to Frederick
                        County; Willa Cather was born in her house. Later she joined the Charles
                        Cather household and moved with them to Nebraska. Rachel Boak’s parents were
                        prototypes for Sapphira and Henry Colbert in <em class="hi">Sapphira and
                           the Slave Girl</em> (1940), and she herself was a prototype for Rachel
                        Blake in that novel and for the title character in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).

                           </span>James was born in Red Cloud, NE, the fifth child and third son of
                        Charles and Virginia Cather. James moved to Wyoming in 1907 to work with his
                        brothers Douglass and Roscoe. In 1913 he married Ethel Garber, and owned and
                        operated clothing stores first in Red Cloud and then Holyoke, CO, where the
                        family settled for a time 1920 before returning to Red Cloud in 1922. The
                        couple had two children, Helen Louise and Charles Edwin. In 1930 the family
                        moved to California so James could work in the oil business with Douglass
                        and his partners. Willa’s relationship with James was more distant than that
                        with her brothers Douglass and Roscoe, who were closer to her own age,
                        although she was very fond of his children.

                        graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in
                        Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in
                        Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin
                        in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914
                        and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in
                        English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she
                        studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in
                        1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then
                        lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA;
                        Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her
                        home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where
                        she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues.
                        Willa Cather's expectation that Elsie be responsible for aging family and
                        friends and for legal affairs after their parents' deaths sometimes brought
                        the sisters into conflict. Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in
                        1942. She died in Lincoln.

                        University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where Cather also knew Louise’s brother
                        Roscoe and sister Olivia. Cather was deeply infatuated with Louise, who was
                        both an outstanding student and an accomplished multi-sport athlete. Pound
                        visited Cather in Red Cloud, NE, several times, but she apparently did not
                        reciprocate Cather’s intense affection, and Cather’s lampoon of Roscoe Pound
                        in “Pastels in Prose” (1894) caused a rift between the two women. Pound
                        earned a B.A. from Nebraska in 1892, an M.A. in 1895, and a Ph.D. from the
                        University of Heidelberg in 1900. She was a professor in the English
                        department at the University of Nebraska, where she taught Cather's sister
                        Elsie, until 1945. From 1954-55 she served as the first female president of
                        the Modern Language Association.

                        Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and
                        was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872.
                        Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War
                        while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the
                        Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage
                        she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa,
                        Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while
                        three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were
                        born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional
                        differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who
                        remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her
                        husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her
                        children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a
                        sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there
                        several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to
                        Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931.
                        Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs.
                        Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s
                        death.

                        novelist Elizabeth Stuart Phelps (1815-1852), Mary Phelps adopted her
                        mother’s name and began publishing short stories at thirteen. Her first
                        adult novel, the bestselling <em class="hi">The Gates Ajar</em> (1868),
                        offered comfort to women grieving the Civil War deaths of the men in their
                        lives by depicting heaven as a domestic idyll. In her long and varied
                        career, Phelps tackled social issues, including women in the professions of
                        business, art, and medicine; working conditions of laborers; temperance; and
                        animal rights. In 1888 she married the much younger Herbert Dickinson Ward,
                        with whom she co-authored several books, but she continued to publish as
                        Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. Cather asked Mariel Gere to send her a copy of

                        with him to Red Cloud, NE, in 1883. They had no children, but her nieces and
                        nephews made frequent long visits. When the various church Ladies Aid
                        societies quarreled about how to help the poor, Fannie Wiener was able to
                        unite the women of the town in the Red Cloud Benevolent Association, in part
                        because, being Jewish, she was outside of sectarian disputes. She fell ill

                        Georgia, Lyra moved with her family to Illinois in 1856 and to California in
                        1859, where her father kept hotels in Nevada County; she first met Silas
                        Garber there in 1866 when he was visiting his elder brother Jacob. Lyra
                        reportedly attended a convent school in Grass Valley, CA, and a finishing
                        school in San Francisco. In 1875, when Silas Garber was governor of
                        Nebraska, he returned to Grass Valley and married Lyra Wheeler. After his
                        term was up in 1878, the couple moved to Red Cloud, NE. Widowed in 1905,
                        Lyra stayed there until 1912. In 1914 settled in Grangeville, ID, where a
                        sister lived, and cut her ties to Nebraska. In 1915, she married Swan
